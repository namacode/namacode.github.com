Aperture has _External Photo Editor_ option. I set Photoshop to it.

View a photo to edit and right click it.

Choose _Edit with Adobe Photoshop..._ and open the photo in Photoshop.

As an example, I added a layer.

Save and close Photoshop. Aperture created a new version, which includes the change on Photoshop.

Aperture keeps the file created by Photoshop. So I can edit the layer again.
